# Lambda-specific requirements for Sinful Delights functions
# 
# Note: The following dependencies are provided by the shared Lambda layer
# and should NOT be included in lambda-specific requirements:
# - boto3~=1.28
# - pydantic~=2.0  
# - python-jose~=3.3
# - requests~=2.31
#
# Only include dependencies that are:
# 1. Specific to this individual Lambda function
# 2. Not included in the shared layer
# 3. Required for this function's unique business logic
#
# Examples of lambda-specific dependencies might include:
# - specialized data processing libraries
# - specific API clients not used by other functions  
# - function-specific validation libraries
# - third-party services integrations unique to this function
#
# For most Sinful Delights functions, this file should be empty or very minimal
# since common dependencies are provided by the shared layer.

# Example lambda-specific dependency (uncomment if needed):
# pillow>=9.0.0  # For image processing in specific functions
# stripe>=5.0.0  # For payment processing functions only
