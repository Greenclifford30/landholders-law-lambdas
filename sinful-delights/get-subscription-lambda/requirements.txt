# This file lists Python dependencies for the "notify_owner" Lambda.

# You can pin specific versions or allow flexible versions. 
# The default Lambda environment includes boto3, but if you 
# need local dev parity or a certain version, include it here.

# If you plan to write unit tests, you may also add:
# pytest~=7.2
